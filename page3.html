<p> "How many times did I tell you not to speak Arabic to him !" yelled my sister. </p>

<p> The fight had been going on for days, but we still could not agree on which language to use to make his education. My mother defended Arabic, to make sure he could understand our Moroccan relatives, whereas my sister insisted on teaching him French, as it was the language we usually used to communicate at home. And my father ? He was already teaching him English, just for the sake of it. </p>

<p> My family had just adopted a new-born puppy.  "What language should we use to speak to the dog ?" might have sounded like a pretty peculiar question to the ears of a vast majority, but to me, it was just another episode of the cultural conflict I grew in, ever since I was three. </p>

<p> I was born and raised in Morocco, by Arabic-speaking muslim parents. At the age of three, I took my first dive in the unknown ocean of another culture, as I entered the French System in elementary school. Ever since then, I was stuck between two worlds. I was a small child already lost between two cultures. As time went by, I started to feel how big of a gap existed between my two main backgrounds : To my teachers I spoke of liberty and democracy, but I still had to cover my legs when visiting my religious grandparents on Sunday afternoons. Undecided was how I felt : Should I live by my teachers" principles of secularism, or should I still follow my familyâ€™s religious and traditional guidelines ? I did not know what choice to make. </p>

<p> I loved sitting with my family, and listening to my grand father praying for us with the Quran on his laps. I liked stuffing my face with sweet moroccan cakes, and the smell of traditional mint tea never failed to thrill my instincts. But I also cherished what school had taught me trough-out the years : I supported democracy, and I was convinced that every person should have the right to exercise autonomy and free-will. Growing up I understood that I did not have to make a choice, thus I came up with my own definition of identity. </p> 

<p> To me, identity is not about belonging to a single culture : It is about adding up parts myself, with every affiliation being as important as the other. And it is that specific mix that made me unique and irreplaceable. I was not born with an identity, and I did not have to chose one. I acquired who I was day after day by being around different people and living different experiences. I did not share my identity with anyone : Not my father, not my mother, not my teacher and not even my friends. I am a patchwork, a blend, and none of the elements that form me as an individual could survive by itself ; when either part of me is attacked, my whole person is affected. </p>

<p> And that is when I realized my strength. I was a hybrid and I could take the path of reconciliation: to people like my family and my teachers, who lived in antagonist universes, I was a link, a mediator. I had the power to fill the gap that seemed to exist between my two backgrounds, and being multilingual only made it easier. </p>

<p> In the mean time, our little puppy also made it to the world of (barking) adulthood. Sure, his purposes were a little different than mine, as they did not go far beyond sleeping, eating and chasing butterflies in our backyard. But just as I did, he grew to become a mediator. </p>

<p> "Sit" "Gless" "Assis". </p>

<p> The light-hearted fights my family used to have turned out to be utterly unfounded, as our dog ended up being perfectly trilingual !
